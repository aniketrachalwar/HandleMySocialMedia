        <div class="space-y-8">
            
            <!-- Tip 1 -->
            <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-2xl p-6">
                <!-- Change the subheading here. -->
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">1. Quality Over Quantity</h2>
                <!-- Change the paragraph text here. -->
                <p class="text-gray-700">
                    Don't get caught in the trap of posting multiple times a day with low-quality content. Instead, focus on creating high-value, engaging posts that truly resonate with your audience. A single, well-crafted post can achieve more than ten rushed ones.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <!-- Tip 2 -->
            <div class="bg-indigo-100 rounded-2xl p-6">
                <!-- Change the subheading here. -->
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-800 mb-4">2. Embrace Video Content</h2>
                <!-- Change the paragraph text here. -->
                <p class="text-indigo-700">
                    Video is king on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and even LinkedIn. Short-form videos, tutorials, and behind-the-scenes glimpses can dramatically increase your engagement. Start with a simple "day in the life" video to show off your company culture.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <!-- Tip 3 -->
            <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-2xl p-6">
                <!-- Change the subheading here. -->
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">3. Engage, Don't Just Post</h2>
                <!-- Change the paragraph text here. -->
                <p class="text-gray-700">
                    Social media is a two-way street. Respond to comments, answer questions in your DMs, and participate in conversations within your industry. This builds a strong community and shows your audience that you genuinely care.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <!-- Tip 4 -->
            <div class="bg-indigo-100 rounded-2xl p-6">
                <!-- Change the subheading here. -->
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-800 mb-4">4. Use Relevant Hashtags</h2>
                <!-- Change the paragraph text here. -->
                <p class="text-indigo-700">
                    Hashtags are a powerful tool for discovery. Research popular and niche hashtags related to your business and use a mix of both. This helps new people find your content and expands your reach beyond your current followers.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <!-- Tip 5 -->

                <!-- Change the subheading here. -->
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">5. Share Your Story</h2>
                <!-- Change the paragraph text here. -->
                <p class="text-gray-700">
                    People connect with people, not just brands. Share personal learnings, company milestones, and the stories behind your success. Authenticity builds trust and loyalty, which are the most valuable assets on social media.
